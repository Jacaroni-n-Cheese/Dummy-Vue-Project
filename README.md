# Dummy-Vue-Project
## Step 1: Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
We need Node to use Vue and other packages.

## Step 2: Create [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) Project
run the command 
`npm init vue@latest`
Your terminal will ask you questions.  Type to enter a project name.  I would add TypeScript but it is up to you.  Only thing you definitely need after that is the Vue Router.  You can say no to everything else.

## Step 3: VSC Extensions
[Vue Language Features](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)

## Step 4: Running The Project
You can use the terminal to run your project.  Use `cd projectname` to make your command directory your new project folder.  After that, you need to install your packages, `npm install`, then to run, `npm run dev` and then press the o key or control click the local http link to open it in your browser.
