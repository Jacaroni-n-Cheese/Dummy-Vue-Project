# Dummy-Vue-Project
## Step 1: Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
We need Node to use Vue and other packages.

## Step 2: Create [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) Project
run the command 
`npm vue init@latest`
Your terminal will ask you questions.  Type to enter a project name.  I would add TypeScript but it is up to you.  Only thing you definitely need after that is the Vue Router.  You can say no to everything else.
